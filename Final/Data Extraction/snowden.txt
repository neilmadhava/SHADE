Our friends at @privacyint—the best NGO in the UK advocating for the privacy rights of everyone—revealed today that the UK government admitted to illegally violating the organization's *own* privacy.https://twitter.com/privacyint/status/1044547574546538496 …

People are like, "what kind of power?" The power to always know everything about anyone, so that you can control the outcome of anything they try to do. Sound abstract? It's your stalker ex, but with a military.

The UK just admitted the global mass surveillance system was used against civil society—people like you. These programs were never about crime or terrorism, they're about power. It's about control.https://twitter.com/privacyint/status/1044547574546538496 …

The battle moves on now to @libertyhq’s litigation challenging the current Snoopers Charter - the Investigatory Powers Act. Many of the legal flaws slammed in today’s decision are baked into that law. The wind is in our sails today.

An incredibly important ruling - court says mass surveillance exposed by @Snowden is unlawful.

Today’s judgment is a huge vindication of @Snowden and others.

In June 2013, within a week of @Snowden I was representing @libertyhq, in challenging @GCHQ bulk surveillance powers.

Had a baby in November. @MunCorpGurugram refuses to issue birth certificate without enrolling the kid for Aadhaar. Filed RTI and in response I got letters from @mlkhattar and @rsprasad to local body that ask for enrollment for Aadhaar, but nowhere that it is mandatory for BC.

No discharge of newborns without Aadhaar.

Women who have given birth, might have been operated on, are being made to stand in line to get an Aadhaar for their child.

So the Gurgaon Municipal Office says that Govt of Haryana notified about mandatory Aadhaar for birth certificate which is in direct contempt of SC and also this GOI notification.

Dear @UIDAI,
What is this policy about non-issuance of birth certificate of newborn without Aadhaar? I can't believe that no institution has any respect for the SC anymore. You expect the newborn and mother to stand in queue for hours for Aadhaar so as to get birth certificate?

The Espionage Act, passed in 1917, was originally intended to be used against foreign spies who stole sensitive military information.

The NSA values AT&T not only because it “has access to information that transits the nation,” but also because it maintains unique relationships with other phone and internet providers, according to the NSA’s documents.https://interc.pt/2yG2mPa

“It’s eye-opening & ominous the extent to which this is happening right here on American soil,” said the Brennan Center's @LizaGoitein. “It puts a face on surveillance that we could never think of before in terms of actual buildings...in our own cities, in our own backyards.”

The NSA monitors what it calls "peering circuits" inside the eight buildings, which one former AT&T technician said "are liable to carry everybody’s [internet] traffic at one point or another during the day, or the week, or the year.”

Our story shows how NSA used AT&T's infrastructure to tap into communications processed by other companies. Data from the likes of Sprint, Cogent, Level 3, Telia, Tata, Telecom Italia, & Deutsche Telekom is sent across AT&T's networks as part of so-called "peering" exchanges.

In 2003, the agency launched an internet surveillance initiative under FAIRVIEW & had within a few months swept up some 400 billion records about people’s online communications. AT&T sent millions of emails weekly to an NSA “keyword selection system.”

In the US, secret evidence risks turning constitutional rights into nothing more than words on paper -- including where massive surveillance is concerned.

Congress should ban this practice now, @hrw says in new report:https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/01/09/dark-side/secret-origins-evidence-us-criminal-cases …

The US Supreme Court's decision today requiring a warrant before police can get information about your location generated by your cell phone is a victory for privacy -- and a recognition that unchecked government surveillance too easily becomes a tool of tyranny.

That moment when you realize you won.

The meaning of the #Carpenter SCT decision is broader than the opinion, confirming recent, newly privacy-conscious judicial decisions were not a fluke. 2013 ended the court's support for a doctrine permitting secret, warrantless access to perfect records of our private lives.

Presumably the privacy scholars, intel officials, and Justice Department lawyers who argued that the NSA’s call-records program was constitutional will now offer a categorical public apology and slink into embarrassed obscurity.  #Carpenter cc: @Snowden

How the Snowden disclosures have changed journalism and privacy, five years later:https://freedom.press/news/how-snowden-has-changed-journalism-and-privacy-five-years-later/ …

Vor fünf Jahren hat @Snowden die massenhafte Spionage der NSA enthüllt. In keinem anderen Land war die Empörung so groß wie in Deutschland - aus zwei Gründen.http://sz.de/1.4004670 

Absolutely. Without @Snowden, the #panamapapers would look very different. 
1) The leaker - John Doe - would very likely not have managed to stay anonymous. 
2) 400 journos could never have worked secretly for more than 1 year.https://twitter.com/cjr/status/1004056402493468673 …

Dear journalists,

Every time you refer to what happened at CIA black sites as "enhanced interrogation techniques," you will lose your readers' respect. 

Call it what it is: Torture.pic.twitter.com/mdGKCoLq2H

Contrast Haspel's behavior with Col. Davis, chief prosecutor at Gitmo, who stood up for law & refused such illegal things. The discretion given to the CIA is by necessity broad. Our country needs leaders, particularly in CIA, with a moral compass. She was tested.  She failed. 2/2https://twitter.com/neal_katyal/status/994247290113142784 …

Ron Wyden, critic of Gina Haspel's, unloading on CIA today. "There is literally an A to Z coverup going on here," he told me. "What you have is selective declassification; you have a public influence campaign being waged by the agency and just a boatload of misinformation."

watergate is such a strong part of the public consciousness because it has a modestly happy ending, whereas iran-contra is a hundred times more revealing about power in America and it’s hardly ever told

Today, @realDonaldTrump’s CIA nominee Gina Haspel claimed that torture occurred during “tumultuous times.” But isn’t during tumultuous times when the rule of law is most important?

What a lede: "The protester who just got thrown out of Gina Haspel’s confirmation hearing used to brief Ronald Reagan every morning."https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/evkg9e/former-cia-ray-mcgovern-protested-at-gina-haspels-cia-confirmation-hearing …

Former senior CIA officer Ray McGovern, former briefer to George HW Bush, was just hauled out of Haspel hearing for denouncing torture.

Haspel won’t answer whether she oversaw the torture of Nashiri. She did. It involved:
• Locking him, naked, in coffin-like boxes
• Slamming him into walls
• Waterboarding himhttps://www.propublica.org/article/gina-haspel-black-site-cia-nashiri-interrogation-cable …

Gina Haspel oversaw the torture of a pregnant woman. They punched Ms. Boudchar in her gravid uterus and chained her to hooks. The baby miraculously survived but was born severely underweight at just 4 pounds. Tell me again how Haspel is a feminist. The GOP is pro-life?

Once you factor out all the introductory statements from Burr/Warner/Bayh/Chambliss, the public hearing on Gina Haspel was 2 hours long. Pompeo's was 5 hours long (& no one ever had any questions for him about his involvement in torture).

I resigned as Chief Prosecutor at #Guantanamo rather than use torture-derived evidence and later was fired from my gov’t job for continuing to speak out. Gina Haspel, Steve Bradbury, Jay Bybee were rewarded for supporting torture. America’s values?https://mobile.nytimes.com/2008/02/17/opinion/17davis.html …

New from me: When Gina Haspel ran the CIA black site for Nashiri’s torture, declassified documents don’t register evidence of dissent. At his next black site, where she wasn’t, there was an interrogator mini-revolt against torturing him.https://www.thedailybeast.com/she-should-have-fought-back-other-people-did-inside-gina-haspels-black-site?ref=home …

The real problem here is that Haspel is the perfect person to run the CIA in the eyes of the CIA--because of her atrocious track record on torture, her refusal to denounce it and her support for destroying evidence.

The @cia has waged a domestic propaganda campaign with selective declassification and blatant social media lobbying to push Haspel through as director. Think about that. This whole thing is an op

In a stunning admission, Gina Haspel tells Sen. King that she is the one who decides what documents the CIA will declassify about HER OWN record.

After less than 3 hours of Gina Haspel's Senate hearing, the TV cameras are being shut off and reporters kicked out. The rest will be behind closed doors — depriving the public of the full truth about her role in CIA torture.

The same Gina Haspel who said "my moral compass is strong" refused to tell the Senate whether she believes torture was right or wrong.https://twitter.com/BuzzFeedNews/status/994241607481217024 …

Questions of Haspel's character miss the point: she was already tested. The only morals in question today are our own.https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/994265062432010240 …

If the Congress confirms Gina Haspel, who admitted to participating in a torture program and personally writing the order to destroy evidence of that crime, is "qualified" to head @CIA, it says more about our government than it does about her.pic.twitter.com/lwQhWed4E8

Journalists working the story of @telegram being blocked in Russia should be absolutely clear that if @Google and @Amazon halt its access to their cloud platform or remove the app from their stores, they are witting collaborators in a censorship campaign, not victims of it.

Roskomnadzor's mad quest to punish @telegram for protecting user's rights has totally broken Russia's internet today. Enormous numbers of sites completely unrelated to Telegram are blocked in a morally and technically ignorant censorship effort. https://meduza.io/en/short/2018/04/17/here-s-how-many-ip-addresses-russia-has-blocked-to-cut-access-to-telegram …https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/986273158603952128 …

I have criticized @telegram's security model in the past, but @Durov's response to the Russian government's totalitarian demand for backdoor access to private communications—refusal and resistance—is the only moral response, and shows real leadership.https://themoscowtimes.com/news/telegram-founder-pledges-millions-fight-russian-political-censorship-61197 …

These Judiciary Committee senators, now questioning Zuckerberg about privacy, voted to extend NSA spying:
-Chuck Grassley
-Dianne Feinstein
-Orrin Hatch
-Sheldon Whitehouse
-Lindsey Graham
-John Cornyn
-Ted Cruz
-Ben Sasse
-Jeff Flake
-Thom Tillis
-John Kennedy
-Amy Klobuchar

This is a relatively tame and friendly hearing for zuck. Most senators just want him to commit to working on their bill or pet idea. Senators asking about monopoloy or political bias havent trapped him. I expected much more aggression. I bet his team will be pretty happy.

the story on Zuckerberg's disappearing messages last week seemed small but really was instructive on how he views his own privacy -- more important to him than the users of his own network. really just damning.

But actions speak louder than wordshttps://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17218756/facebook-biometric-privacy-lobbying-bipa-illinois …

What Zuck just said - FB's obligation to ensure FB is "used for good" - is scary.

I do not want Facebook deciding what is "good." Neither should you.

Facebook: "This is their information. They own it"
BBC: "And you won’t sell it?"
FB: "No! Of course not."

This is classic Facebook: Grassley asks about Facebook's data usage practices, and Zuckerberg gives an answer about audience controls. FB always tries to frame privacy as you vs the world, not you vs Facebook. #ZuckerBowl

This is bizarre. 

Zuckerberg keeps saying special consent for face recognition is appropriate

Yet *literally this Thursday* Facebook-backed lobbyists and Facebook-backed lawmakers are working to gut the nation's strongest face recognition privacy law.https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17218756/facebook-biometric-privacy-lobbying-bipa-illinois …

Yet (did anyone else catch this) Zuckerberg seems to have acknowledged that some higher level of consent should be required for face recognition.
 
--> FB has enrolled the majority of its 2 billion users into a face recognition database without expressly asking their permission.

In a roundabout way, Zuckerberg basically just acknowledged GDPR privacy protections are not being fully extended to the United States, as @David_Ingram originally reported

In case you were wondering why Congress today is treating Facebook's CEO like an old friend rather than grilling him (they didn't even require him to be sworn in):https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/981662712966066176 …

"This is information that was public for most users..." Yes, AFTER Facebook forced all users to make it public in the 2009 privacy transition. Gee whiz, Mark.

Before you read or watch Facebook's CEO testifying today, you need to read this. He's not sorry: every activity we've seen from this company is part of the same unbroken strategy of deception.https://twitter.com/ashk4n/status/983725115903852544 …

The  Sun writer laughed & said cops & courts see it as an alternative perspective

Suspended by @facebook. For blowing the whistle. On something they have known privately for 2 years.pic.twitter.com/iSu6VwqUdG

It's a shame Facebook as a whole didn't do a better job weighing. Last night they threatened to sue the Observer/Guardian to stop this story coming out. Maybe you can explain that one.https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/975069709140877312 …

Businesses that make money by collecting and selling detailed records of private lives were once plainly described as "surveillance companies." Their rebranding as "social media" is the most successful deception since the Department of War became the Department of Defense.

Facebook never fessed up to this until the Guardian and the Times were about to publishhttps://twitter.com/dickstevenson/status/975037029854728193 …

Facebook makes their money by exploiting and selling intimate details about the private lives of millions, far beyond the scant details you voluntarily post. They are not victims. They are accomplices.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/17/us/politics/cambridge-analytica-trump-campaign.html …

NEW: Confused by what Gina Haspel's specific role in black-site torture was? Civil-liberties groups have an easy remedy – declassify it all, before her nomination to run CIA moves forward.https://www.thedailybeast.com/declassify-gina-haspels-role-in-cia-torture-rights-groups-demand/ …

Alberto Mora and Gina Haspel were both pressured by the Bush Administration to implement torture programs.

Mora refused. Haspel didn't. She has been nominated to be the CIA director. What does Mora have to say about Haspel?https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/15/gina-haspel-is-a-torturer-thats-all-the-senate-needs-to-know-217641 …

Now would be a really good time for somebody with access to leak the full, unredacted SSCI CIA torture program investigative report—or at least put a hold on Haspel’s nomination until the report is released.

The quotes in this piece are some of the most blunt you'll ever see from civil liberties groups: “We do not believe she should be director of the CIA. Rather, she should be in jail.”https://twitter.com/attackerman/status/974104329505427456 …

Oh look what they’re floating in the wake of Salisbury: tighten up the Official Secrets Act with longer jail sentences for journalists. Because that will really help stop it happening againpic.twitter.com/xcpObXMBkM

That’s right. Torture is also a federal and int’l crime and is categorically prohibited under the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions which were ratified by United States and thus considered the supreme law of the land under the U.S. Constitution.https://twitter.com/snowden/status/974291545598889985 …

This is our view at @theCCR.  There are plenty in the media who will talk about career service, stability in CIA transition and following orders.  But torture is neither a qualification for leadership nor a commendation for being a team player.  It's a crime.https://twitter.com/theCCR/status/974291112960712711 …

Listen, you can defend torture, or you can defend the Constitution. Not both. The 8th Amendment explicitly forbids torture with all forms of cruel and unusual punishment. To defend torture is to attack the Constitution.

NARRATOR: Actually, the US Senate's reviewed 6,300,000 classified CIA torture files, finding "the CIA's brutal interrogations of terrorism suspects produced no useful intelligence." Torture stopped no attacks, and saved no lives. https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-torture-report-20141210-story.html …https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/973673412785827840 …

The CIA threatened to rape and kill the mothers of the tortured. They went on to rape those on hunger strikes with food products, claiming it was for their health. Doctors disagreed, describing it as rape and finding it left injuries consistent with rape.https://www.bustle.com/articles/53334-the-12-worst-findings-from-the-cia-torture-report-conducted-by-the-senate-intelligence-committee …

Even the US Senate, who famously defended unconstitutional intelligence abuses, conceded after a full review of the torture program's classified records that no useful intelligence was gained via torture, no lives were saved, and no attacks were stopped.https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-torture-report-20141210-story.html …

That's an easily demonstrable lie. The @CIA's own Inspector General admitted Gul Rahman was tortured and starved until he froze to death, which the CIA then lied about to conceal this fact.

Should have put a finer point on this. Trump's nominee for CIA Director is *quite literally* a war criminal. This is the import of Hamdan v.

On new #CIA director Gina #Haspel: In 2017 @ECCHRBerlin called on Germany's Public Prosecutor to issue arrest warrant against Haspel bc she oversaw #torture https://www.ecchr.eu/en/our_work/international-crimes-and-accountability/u-s-accountability/germany.html …; She'd fall within #ICC Afghanistan-plus investigation of US #CIA torturehttps://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/16/icc-us-accountable-for-crimes-afghanistan …

Another mind-boggling paragraph from this Dexter Filkins post from last year on the new CIA director. If Obama had allowed prosecutions over CIA torture, "people like Haspel, quite plausibly, could have gone to prison." Instead, she's going to run the CIA. https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-new-c-i-a-deputy-chiefs-black-site-past …pic.twitter.com/2avwLewIe3

We got off the plane with Tillerson less than four hours ago. There was zero indication on flight home that this was imminent.

Tillerson intended to stay on as secretary state, is "unaware of the reason" for his dismissal, per Under Secretary of State Steve Goldstein.

This isn't a radical departure for CIA. After all, Haspel did this under George Tenet. At the time, John Brennan - who became Obama's CIA director - was an advocate of rendition & other torture methods. And Pompeo was fine with black sites. Still notable: she's an actual torturer

Haspel, who will be the first woman to lead CIA, didn't just oversee the Bush CIA's black site but directly participated in the horrific torture of detainees. She also participated in the particularly gruesome torture of detainee Abu Zubaydahhttps://theintercept.com/2017/02/02/trumps-cia-chief-selects-major-torture-operative-to-be-agencys-deputy-director/ …

As Mike Pompeo replaces Rex Tillerson as the Sec. of State, Gina Haspel will be the new CIA Director

In 2017 the European Center for Constitutional Rights called on Germany's Public Prosecutor General to issue an arrest warrant against Haspel over claims she oversaw the torture

But if that’s right, it’s an indictment not of privacy advocates, or of the “progressive narrative,” but of the institutions tasked with oversight, which have proven themselves unworthy of the trust that Americans have placed in them.  END

Would American have been less likely to listen to Nunes if the last 17 years hadn’t undermined their faith in institutions tasked with overseeing government surveillance?  Maybe.  10/

But one doesn’t have to believe that officials will “always” act in bad faith, or even that they often will, to conclude that this system is not one that will adequately protect individual rights. 9/

1/ The NYT runs an op-ed by ex-FBI agent @AshaRangappa_ blaming "progressive and privacy advocates" for the Nunes Memo. Their crime? Sowing mistrust about secret eavesdropping powers.

The memo doesn't come close to saying what Hannity and company want it to say. It clearly is cherry-picked. It is also laughable, as the Democrats and FBI allege, that this "memo" harms national security. What a shit show of dishonesty across the board.

The 1978 basis for creating a secret #FISA court (#FISC) was that "real" courts wouldn't be able to hide surveillance from suspects. But for decades since, real courts have regularly overseen surveillance against sophisticated criminals and won convictions. Real courts work fine.https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/959500212376145921 …

Yes without sharing aadhar no you can't get  sim card ,insurance ,bank account ,delivery of  goods shopped online ,even if you have old bank account or insurance policies (with Pvt or govt companies ) you can't continue with those without sharing your aadhar no.

Operators threaten users with disconnection of service if they fail to link their #Aadhaar card to their mobile numbers. Banks are also threatening account closures. Threatening in India appears to have become a standard practice.

That might be true if banks, landlords, hospitals, schools, telephone & internet companies were prohibited by law from asking for your #Aadhaar number. But any Indian can tell you they're asked for their number by non-government entities––and those companies have databases too.https://twitter.com/UIDAI/status/953488708803571712 …

FWIW: When you realise that both a former RAW chief & @Snowden are arguing there's something wrong with #Aadhaar

Of course not, but when the chairman of House Intel (HPSCI) claims there's documented evidence of serious surveillance abuses, it matters. If true, the citizens must see the proof. If false, it establishes HPSCI lies and has no credibility. Either outcome benefits the public. https://twitter.com/StrangeCapn/status/954346948986900480 …

I'd also like to express a degree of contempt for the GOP members of Congress acting so scandalized over alleged abuses of FISA & spying powers when, just last week, they worked with Pelosi, Schiff & Feinstein to block all reforms & safeguards. (Meadows isn't one but many are).

Officials confirm there's a secret report showing abuses of spy law Congress voted to reauthorize this week. If this memo had been known prior to the vote, FISA reauth would have failed.

House votes 256-164 to expand Trump's warrantless surveillance powers for the next six years. The vote to reform warrantless searches of Americans' phone calls and e-mails failed, needing the support of 26 more. Dems could have swung it, but 55 of them voted with the Trump camp.

Thanks in large part to @NancyPelosi's support, the House just voted to authorize warrantless searches of Americans' phone calls and e-mails.

Rep. Amash amendment to add warrant requirement to U.S. queries of 702 data fails 183-233. 58 Republicans and 125 Democrats voted for it; 178 Republicans and 55 Democrats against it.

Democrats could have swung the vote had they wanted to.

The USA Rights Act was just voted down (with assistance from Dems, sadly). The vote on Trump's expanded warrantless surveillance bill is now imminent.

Ryan is saber rattling about consequences of USA Rights Act, saying it would cause the IC to go dark. That's just not true. He also misrepresents the HPSCI bill saying it protects Americans' privacy. Privacy experts (like me) say it makes the law worse.

3) The FBI performs those searches without a warrant.
4) The FBI does it so frequently they say the number is impossible to track.
5) The expanded surveillance powers Trump & Ryan are seeking protect the privacy of criminals under investigation, but not innocent Americans. #FISAhttps://twitter.com/MiekeEoyang/status/951482105493630978 …

Amash is offering closing remarks. 702 allows an astounding amount of Americans' communications to be collected and accessed. USA Rights Act protects Americans' rights. For all who care about civil liberties & think US can protect itself w/out retiring 4th Am, support USA Rights.

Opponents of 702 reform are pushing two obviously contradictory messages: “This is just about foreigners outside the U.S.” and “If we can’t search for Americans’ emails without a warrant, it will CRIPPLE the program.”  You kinda have to pick one.

Say it with me: Nothing in the @justinamash amendment stops 702 from spying on foreigners overseas. Just about how to use info about Americans.

FISA/702 is a really important tool to identify foreign threats, but @charlie_savage nails the problem of the base bill vs. the @justinamash substitute in today's vote.

Finally, note that the US media *hated* Ellsberg. They were furious that he revealed so much secret information, and thought he was arrogant for believing he had the right to decide. The attacks on whistleblowers are universal & the script hasn't changed in 50 years.pic.twitter.com/HikxZcW1EP

As I've noted before, a key attack from the Nixon WH on Ellsberg - especially in the middle of Watergate - was that Ellsberg wasn't really a whistleblower, but rather a Kremlin agent who gave all the Pentagon Papers to Moscow. Sound familiar? Ellsberg in the '73 interview:pic.twitter.com/ccGDEPHVmX

In 1973, Ellsberg warned that official Washington will always invent and exaggerate foreign threats - both to increase its own secrecy and war-making powers but also to serve the private industries that run DC. Again, this is all as applicable to today as then.pic.twitter.com/Dh6FtMc5z9

Back in 1973, Ellsberg was already warning that - since the end of War War II - the US presidency has basically become all-powerful, with no limits, including even starting wars in secret. It's gotten so much worse since 9/11.pic.twitter.com/gWgyLqu0bm

Rolling Stone published its full 1973 interview with @DanielEllsberg and it's really fascinating. So much of it applies to today.

PSA: I will be referring to the Intel kernel memory issue as “Chipocalypse” — please credit me if you use this term any of your coverage.

We translated Intel's crap attempt to spin its way out of CPU security bug PR nightmarehttp://reg.cx/2vM2 

Fun fact: Intel has ignored every request for comment and clarification we made this week.

AMD + Arm responded with info. Arm doubly so.

It is the natural tendency of government to desire perfect records of private lives. History shows that no matter the laws, the result is abuse. https://twitter.com/zackwhittaker/status/948999538731311105 …

E.g. it is absolutely unacceptable there exists an embedded system (#IntelME) within our processors which has (hardware) DMA capability to access host memory. It is merely irrelevant if/how the _current_ ME firmware makes use of it.

When Intel says "this isn't a bug" what it really means is "please don't make us recall millions of faulty processors"pic.twitter.com/NPU3WSEjSI

To be clear: Google could whitelist Signal and Tor, and incur basically no sanctions liabilities. And civil society has been writing and meeting with Google about GAE since 2013.

Sanctions compliance is hard but what’s frustrating is Google could have —

1.)  applied for a specific license from OFAC;
2.) whitelisted important services like Tor and Signal. 

And none of these sanctions concerns necessitate wholesale blocking of visiting GAE sites!

This thread is a good articulation of these concerns #Iranprotestshttps://twitter.com/snowden/status/947190333540061185 …

Governments learn slowly, but they do learn. There comes a day when it will be too late to fix these problems, and I fear it is sooner than we think.

Governments are becoming more abusive, not less, on the internet, especially in places like Iran, China, and Russia. @Durov said @Telegram has 25,000,000 daily users in Iran. He could be converting them all to 2FA. He could be teaching them how to use Tor bridges. I hope he will.

We've seen some improvements, and that's not nothing. But not the revolutionary rework it needs. Telegram still seems to encourage dangerous cloud messaging instead of secret chats. Experts ask "why?" And the answer is "convenience." That's unsafe.

Trust us not to turn over data. Trust us not to read your messages. Trust us not to close your channel. Maybe @Durov is an angel. I hope so! But angels have fallen before. Telegram should have been working to make channels decentralized—meaning outside their control—for years.

And this is where we start getting to my core concerns. @Telegram has for years faced criticisms about the basic structure of its security by prominent cryptographers and technologists. Many defenses rely upon unbroken trust in a central authority (the company). "Trust us."

You can't keep an independent, destabilizing service from being blocked in authoritarian regimes, you can only delay it. So you need to be thinking about how to continuing protecting people by making the service accessible *even after the block.*

If we presume @Durov is acting morally, this might sound like an argument for Telegram to do whatever they can to keep their Iranian presence alive. But this is unsustainable, which he should know: after all, he was forced from Russia for not doing enough favors at Vkontakte.

Should Telegram shut one Iranian channel down to preserve access to all the others? Most would say "of course." It's more important to keep that tether to their ecosystem alive, right? They're in something close to a monopoly position, where the fallback for many is unsafe SMS.

On the other, it means @Telegram will face increasing pressure over time to collaborate with the Iranian government's demands for this or that. Today we saw the communications minister demand a big channel be shut down. And here's where we start getting into complexity.

This is both a good and bad thing. On one hand, keeping people who don't understand and will never learn what Tor and VPNs connected to a big and difficult-to-moderate communications ecosystem is valuable, when the government largely has but two moves: "block" or "not block."

Background: @Telegram has a special position in Iran. Its "public channels" are an important source of news for many low-tech users. Competing services are often blocked, but Telegram makes concessions to avoid this (like setting up local CDNs https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2017/07/telegrams-efforts-to-increase-download-speed-in-iran-could-aid-state-censors/ … ).

Many don't seem to understand why I object to @Telegram having unsafe, censorable public channels in an app that is promoted as a secure messenger. Some presumed I just don't understand how channels work. So let's talk about it:

Surprisingly candid statement from a former NSA worker (TAO, per @nytimes). Some say the 2013 NSA reporting "didn't change anything," but just a few years ago, NSA-ers wouldn't dare avow something like this. Love it or hate it, that's progress.

Seriously.  (1) whether it's "key" is the whole debate; (2) it's used to monitor Americans; (3) gov't has said it's going to keep using the authority after Dec. 31; (4) who's doing the "fear[ing]" here? (5) "lapse," like "key," assumes the conclusion.https://twitter.com/benwizner/status/942752607482900482 …

Part of the prosecution's argument for why one of the defendants—photojournalist Alexei Wood—didn't count as a "journalist" was that he knew what the word "kettling" meant.

Mass surveillance was never classified to save lives. It was classified because the government knew if a real court ruled on it, they would declare it unconstitutional. Since 2013, they have.

VPNs are good for hiding traffic from your ISP (Verizon, Comcast, or whoever sits between you and the internet). But they are not magical internet invisibility cloaks: the VPN now gets to see what the ISP no longer can.

A VPN is a one-hop, single point of failure. Your VPN provider can see all of your activity. So can NSA. Tor mixes traffic in a better way across a wider network. Even if the first or last hop is bad, they don't know what you're doing (entrance node) or where you are (exit node).https://twitter.com/Witcher_01/status/941013218096570368 …

Some questions for reporters to ask Netflix:
—How many employees have access to people's viewing habits?
—Are there any controls on how they can access this data/what it can be used for? 
—What's the punishment for creeping on people?
—Why are they publicly shaming customers?https://twitter.com/netflix/status/940051734650503168 …

Fact check: 106,469 people in 2016 were targeted—without warrants—under just one program. NSA alone also kept records of at least 151,230,968 phone calls.

In partnership with our friends at @knightcolumbia, we just sued the Trump Justice Dept to find out how much power it has to monitor and surveil journalists.https://splinternews.com/free-press-groups-sue-the-government-to-find-out-how-mu-1820839293 …

Apple-China collusion really hit home when a Wuzhen volunteer handed me his brand new iPhone and asked how he could download a VPN and read the WSJ. I could find none on iOS china app store. Apple’s taken most away. @GreatFireChina says Apple took 674 VPN apps away this year.

As we flirt with nuclear war for the first time in decades, @DanielEllsberg releases perhaps the most authoritative work ever produced on the subject (he helped write the plans!).https://www.amazon.com/Doomsday-Machine-Confessions-Nuclear-Planner/dp/1608196704/ …

"I identify more with Chelsea Manning and with Edward Snowden than with any other people on earth. We all faced the same question which is, who will put this information out if I don’t?" -Daniel Ellsberg, who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971https://n.pr/2iPwbFQ 

Governments increasingly claim companies have "a legal duty to allow for secret surveillance." Such policies mark a new wave of illiberal thinking even in places like Germany; one that sees no private companies, only potential deputies.https://www.thelocal.de/20171201/german-government-wants-backdoor-access-to-every-digital-device-report …

I don’t want to make predictions about Carpenter, but plainly the Court is *much* more concerned about the privacy implications of new technology today than it was five years ago.  Q: What would Carpenter argument have been like without @Snowden’s disclosures?

I believe this was probably the most significant part of oral arguments: Roberts, citing Riley, argued that cellphones should be treated as a necessity of modern living, not a voluntary choice.

And let's not forget the work put in here by Jones. It's starting to feel like the tide is turning for the first time in decades.

Edward mentioned us in some interviews in 2014, but we have never had a formal relationship with him. (One of his strengths is his impartiality and honesty.)

We're not likely to bury Smith v. Maryland and all its associated malignancies just yet, but make no mistake: winning in Riley and Carpenter would mark an astonishing change in judicial permissiveness toward even the most transparent abuses of surveillance authority.

Suggesting the Supreme Court might reject the government's totalitarian interpretation of third party doctrine was absolutely unthinkable just a few short years ago. Yet here we are. We might win this one yet. #GetAWarrant

Vital but daunting because 4th Amendment doctrine relies so heavily on a factual premise that is plainly false in a networked, interdependent society.

Today we officially launch the @AINowInstitute at NYU! Grateful to be part of an incredible community of scholars in multiple disciplines working on the social and political implications of AI, ML and algorithmic accountability.

The guy who oversees the government's stockpiling of digital weapons chastised reporters today for using the word "stockpiling," which basically guaranteed reports on it so far include it. @zackwhittaker worked it in 4 times!https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-rules/trump-administration-releases-rules-on-disclosing-cyber-flaws-idUSKBN1DF0A0 …

Thanks to @Snowden's revelations the European Court of Human Rights could recognize and declare mass surveillance as violation of human rights to privacy and freedom of expression https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/european-court-ruling-could-recognize-mass … via @aclu @privacyint @amnesty

Ugh, Rob Joyce completely mischaracterized efforts to reform 702. Fails to recognize emergency exceptions, gaping hole of FI exception.

That government is finally opening up about the Vulnerabilities Equities Process is positive, but Joyce's refusal to acknowledge, confront, and discuss remediating the problems highlighted by NSA's ETERNAL suite knocking out US & UK hospitals shows we have a long way to go.

The percentage of vulnerabilites the government discloses to vendors is largely PR: The public harm of maintaining 10 high severity flaws far outweighs the benefit of disclosing 90 low severity ones. We need to know the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities, not just the number.

The new VEP is online. Find it here: https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/images/External%20-%20Unclassified%20VEP%20Charter%20FINAL.PDF …

Journalists writing up the VEP plan today: most important revelation was enormous loophole permitting digital arms brokers to exempt (via routine NDAs used when proliferating bugs to >1 buyer) critical flaws in US infrastructure from disclosure no matter the cost to our security.

The most critical mission of any spy agency is the capture of their own legislature. Since 2013 we've seen it in Germany, France, China, the UK, Russia, and the Netherlands. Now we see it in America, too.https://twitter.com/charlie_savage/status/930808738121900033 …

If you ever cared about facts/specifics, @JoyAnnReid, we wouldn’t be having this discussion today. But here, anyway, are some of the many positive impacts @Snowden’s revelations had on people’s lives.pic.twitter.com/szTH5ONBtx

Call me blasphemous but I'm pretty sure it's possible to oppose Trump without worshiping at the altar of the American Intelligence Community.

Thanks to Snowden:
- Most websites use HTTPS, making EVERYONE more secure not just against NSA, but against all nation-states and criminal hackers
- Encrypted messaging apps are widely available, easy to use. Journalists and sources under Trump can communicate more safely today

Snowden's disclosures led directly to Obama's PPD 28, extending privacy rights to foreigners, and passage of a Patriot Act overhaul ending bulk call records collection. Question the rightness of leaks, but hard to dispute there was a clear non-Russia impact

Joy Reid has spent four years depicting NSA reporting as criminal & treasonous (just as Trump does), while accusing Snowden of being a Russian spy (just as Nixon WH did to Ellsberg). Remember, though: the #Resistance loves press freedom!https://twitter.com/ZachJCarter/status/930067361511636992 …

Citizens of every country have a right to know the illegal actions of their government.

Snowden revealed PRISM, XKeyscore, tapping fiber optic cables, phone records, MYSTIC, and others.

A real journalist would know these things.

Feels like a long time ago that we had this inspiring encounter @Snowden #WriteForRights @amnestyhttps://twitter.com/amnestyuk/status/928618396715012096 …

We want to protect #whistleblowers in #Poland. The government must improve draft legislation. Check the joint letter with @whistleblowing:pic.twitter.com/AlRWv6Auml

Finally got around to watching the @Snowden movie.  I’m sure this barely scratches the surface of the narrative, but it was a well done story.

People targeted by secret US surveillance programs that courts ruled were illegal seem to have benefited. Also, actual journalists seem to have benefited by learning what their governments were doing in the dark: the purpose of journalism.https://twitter.com/JoyAnnReid/status/929918804242653184 …

Members of the lionized SEAL Team 6 suspected of murdering a Green Beret who discovered their theft. Great reporting from Kevin Maurer & @attackermanhttps://www.thedailybeast.com/green-beret-discovered-seals-illicit-cash-then-he-was-killed …

Only hundreds of millions of civilians in the US, and billions worldwide, benefitted from @Snowden’s revelations about the ILLEGAL violations of their privacy rights.

You’re an embarrassment, an insult, to journalism, @JoyAnnReid.https://twitter.com/joyannreid/status/929918804242653184 …

At @FreedomofPress, @xor built an open source tool to help Gothamist and DNAinfo journalists grab their archives.https://freedom.press/news/saving-gothamist-archives-journalisms-billionaire-problem/ …

This week Europe’s top human rights court is hearing about the U.K.’s mass spying – and how the surveillance was shared with the NSA.https://www.aclu.org/news/european-court-human-rights-hear-challenge-uk-government-mass-surveillance-tuesday …

European Court to decide whether U.K. mass surveillance revealed by Snowden violates human rights https://interc.pt/2zDTOb4  by @rj_gallagher

Responding via conventional weapons--missiles, bombs, bullets--rather than "hacking back."https://twitter.com/LBrain1010011/status/928001609010950144 …

This is a term of art. Attributable: people know you did it. Non-attributable: they can't. Mis-attributable: they think someone else did it.

The result is we'll have LESS ability to track and attribute adversary hacking (consequences = caution), and we'll bomb the wrong people.https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/927995530365595654 …

If govs launch kinetic attacks in response to hacks, even the laziest CNE operators will use misattributable kit & C2. Sound good? It's not.

...Because there are no meaningful consequences for getting caught relative to the effort of developing a new ops kit and infrastructure.

In routine CNE (hacking) ops, adversaries don't care that much about getting caught. They reuse tools and C2 infrastructure which ID them.

I worked counter-cyber @NSAGov using pre-reform mass surveillance. Problem is attribution can't happen unless the adversary makes mistakes.https://twitter.com/jeremiahg/status/927975743165833216 …

This looks like a Big Deal. I hope  this will lead to a lawsuit against Intel for its gross negligence, exposing users to risks. Congrats!https://twitter.com/_markel___/status/910567298083250182 …

The Spanish crackdown on inconvenient speech, politics, and assembly in #Catalonia is a violation of human rights.https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/21/catalonia-bloack-catalonia-referendum-rights-mariano-rajoy-carles-puigdemont …
