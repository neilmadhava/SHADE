doing stuff that isn't sleeping is hard

Transgender people... are people. Not a political stance, not an ideology, not an agenda... human beings, across a spectrum of beliefs and experiences.

There’s no such thing as “I don’t agree with transgender.” We are a group of people that exist; our existence isn’t a question.

listen, it's not my fault i don't love myself

ok i’m done for the night https://twitter.com/sosadtoday/status/1053865923688357888 …

ask me anything

i think you've mistaken my low self-esteem for kindness

ignore at first sight

high on existential dread

*watches life fall apart*

i don’t have a brand i have a compulsive need to escape myself

want to touch my anxiety?

person: hi

me: i'm sorry i'm not enough

how doomed do you think i am?

no i can’t just “believe in myself”

high on soda

Wow, I can't wait to not talk to people all weekend.

every time i get out of bed is a disaster

i never know what the hell anyone is talking about

if you liked the chapter in So Sad Today "Love Like You Are Trying to Fill a Spiritual Hole with Another Human Being Who Will Suffocate in There" then read my novel, The Pisceshttps://www.amazon.com/Pisces-Novel-Melissa-Broder/dp/1524761559/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1539907470&sr=8-1&keywords=the+pisces …

feeling hopeless dot gov

5 moods in 5 minutes

it has been confirmed that i am not enough

come over and give up on me

here let me just rip my heart out and give it to you

seems like everyone is a professional selfie taker and i'm just eating cereal

just spent 2 hours with people so now i need a week alone

Life is a delicate balance between managing your depression & letting time slowly destroy your body.

don't mind me I'm not really alive

hating myself just seems natural

bitch i am fear of failure

look, i hate myself as much as the next guy

bucket list:

-go back to bed

https://twitter.com/Cl_ribes/status/1051521844946325504 …

will probably hate my body till like 5 minutes before i die and then be like wait

i liked you better when you were imaginary

1. wake up
2. try to figure out who hates me so i can waste my life attempting to win their love

can I count on you to let me down?

oh fuck i'm still me

when i'm by myself i'm almost ok

hell! starring other people

*apologizes to person who wronged me for them wronging me*

should i go to bed bath and beyond?

i feel guilty for things i didn’t even do

if i don’t go to a pumpkin patch this weekend i’m going to fucking snap

let's spend the rest of our lives thinking about each other except i get to stop thinking about you but you have to keep thinking about me

on this episode i talk about laughing cow cheese, death, astrological love bullshit, dying, a vacuum, my cremation, and the stunning conclusion of peeing in a starbucks cup

welcome to another episode of the eating alone in my car show with your host so sad todayhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/eating-alone-in-my-car/id1391561169?mt=2#episodeGuid=bc52fb91-2cb0-f774-4ab9-24e419746d83 …

my problem areas are my body and my mind

Was Ursula even a villain or did Ariel’s dumb ass just not read the contract????

watching myself fuck up in slow motion

someone just emailed me and was like "i'm agitated, is your book saying people should blame their parents for their problems?" and i'm like "NO!"(but secretly yes lol)

*panics over something dumb*

i’m at subway living my dreams

no i can't just "get out of bed"

for some of us, tomorrow is also mental health awareness day and also the next day and the next day and the next day

i think my house is haunted but unfortunately not by anything cool that’s trying to kill me

"you might be my soulmate" -me to 100000 people

consciousness is a disaster

*sees red flags*

*ignores them*

protect me from what i want and also from what i don't want and also from having to talk to anyone

i came, i saw, i felt like people were judging me

oops, totally didn't mean to be emotionally honest

"it just gives me a lot of anxiety" --me about everything

unfortunately i'm very self-aware

step 1: wake up
step 2: be not enough

powerpoint presentation of my insecurities

it takes 374621962558361 x the amount of time you knew someone to get over them

getting over people is a fucking miracle

making the same mistakes and expecting different results and lovin it

inside i'm sleeping

beware the fuckboy who talks about fuckboys as though he is not a fuckboy

imagining a world without frat boys

i hate you come over

i did everything wrong today and i did it with low self-esteem

siri, how can i be a good person but without any discomfort on my part

poetry is wasted on longing for boys

i feel upset but not surprised by humanity

sorry to hear about your positive attitude

sun in no, moon in oh fuck, i need to be alone rising

The people! United! Are crying on the couch!

what the fuck is everything

i feel empty and unsure dot com

'sensitive' boys are even more dangerous than regular boys

boy: i'm a feminist
boy: so you should fuck me

what if my destiny sucks

watching myself get more insecure in slow motion

just ignore the cold universe

"this is the worst feeling" --me about any feeling

officially at war with my body

in theory i'm totally over you

it's all good --me lying

every day is depression awareness day

got over you but then saw you again

meditating on my shittiness

just forgot that life is pain and then remembered again

sun in 7-11, moon in subway, cheesecake factory rising

let's pretend i'm better looking than i am

so sad today

Sure taking care of yourself feels good but have you ever tried taking terrible care of yourself? For a little while it feels AMAZING.

when you realize everything is stupid it feels lonely

the purpose of our government, as found in the constitution, is to "establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our posterity” lololololololol 

take a lot of naps and ignore a lot of people

if you're insecure, anxious, self-obsessed and lonely at least be amazing at it

i'm so not necessary

yeah i retweet myself i got a fuckin problem

Ever just look at a dude and know his name is "Brett".

reminder that after 5 minutes i always want to leave

i’m either acting out or hiding from everything

i pretend to be strong so people will leave me alone

not to toot my own tweet but is the nobel committee even paying attention or are they too busy with someone “curing diseases”

i mean these are some hot tweetems right here

let’s all take a moment and be brutally honest with ourselves...my tweets are really good tonight

should i just casually destroy my life

what do you mean you don’t think it’s weird we are alive

pharmacist: the generic prozac capsule is no different than the generic prozac pill, it’s just the manufacturer is different 

me: i don’t recognize this world around me. time and space have lost their relevance. what are we even made of? are you even real?

i'm always late for everything because i don't want to be anywhere

gonna stop worrying about shit beyond my control just kidding

so annoyed that fantasy isn't reality

Hey! Create a web presence! Be fun and dynamic! Then slip into a major depression brought on by lack of human communication and join a dangerous cult! Then workout constantly and get scary and agressive! Then finally become a chef!

oh great another hour of my life

if i have to watch my whole life flash before my eyes when i die i'm going to be so annoyed

everything is so full of shit

being born is so mean

brb, the world has fallen short of my unrealistic expectations

no i don't have any self esteem, what do you think i am a person with self-esteem?

time heals all wounds no it doesn't

preppy men are terrifying

shopping list:
-self-esteem
-the ability to say no without feeling like a bitch
-a few moments of peace
-new body

ever just feel paranoid as fuck for your entire life

*whispers during sex* i just needed to escape myself

i want to make out with 100 people and also be alone

i have to be punched in the face by my loneliness before i reach out to someone

should we bother being in each other's lives if we can't make out

it’s not my fault i’m from another planet

cause of death: your positive attitude

In the middle of the night it’s Poetry that waits for you

*me flirting with someone* so i've never liked living in a body

watching people be normal and i just don't understand

i’m not a courageous person i’m just impulsive

help i can't stop thinking

pretend you miss me thanks!

hire me to dj your party while laying on the floor

forbidden love...because unforbidden love is for those who are okay with genuine intimacy

find what you love and maintain a fear of intimacy

i fucking love @samanthajhunt’s book The Seas (i was destroyed by it) and talked with her about romantic obsession, reality and mer-creatureshttps://www.elle.com/culture/books/a23128576/melissa-broder-samantha-hunt-interview/ …

someone with a clipboard just came up to me and said “would you like to save a baby today?” and i accidentally said “sorry i’m not a fan of children”

i think i’ll spend the day imagining the worst

body negativity

oh fuck i’m having a memory

but i love setting myself up for disappointment

if you can’t handle me at my insomnia all night then you don’t deserve me at my sleeping all day

having carefully read your tweets, i’ve reached the conclusion that you’re all very annoying

for the love of god can someone just get me out of my body

*whispers during sex* i hate having a body

BIG DEATH ENERGY

[flirting] I’m but a vessel for an ancient trauma

excited for my expectations to turn into resentments

i don't have to prove anything to anyone! (except the negative voices in my head and anyone who ever rejected me)

is body dysmorphia still body dysmorphia if i’m actually gross?

i miss you never contact me again

cause of death: couples calling each other "babe"

i’m officially done growing as a person. thank you.

i’m definitely getting grosser

writing is so isolating which is why it’s my sport

lil excerpt from what will be my next novel...or my next next novel... hehepic.twitter.com/6vEtOMf2Kq

sorry, i can't, i'm busy watching everything get worse

one small positive thought in the morning can disappoint the shit out of you for the rest of the day

sorry but i hate everything more than you do

i'll give me something to cry about

the good thing about never expressing my needs is no one knows how crazy they are

i'm 44% sex dreams, 56% cereal

blood type: self-doubt

I’m sorry but reality is bullshit

what do you mean the universe can't just cater to my every desire?

i feel like everyone who follows this account knows i have a podcast, but then people are like ‘wait you have a podcast?’ 

anyway new episodehttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/eating-alone-in-my-car/id1391561169?mt=2#episodeGuid=ce3d4421-0042-40d5-9170-88dfa96dfa3a …

i’ve made the big leap from no self-esteem to very low self-esteem

my body is a hotel for anxiety

sleeping all day speaks louder than words

my attitude was good for two minutes

my self-hatred is organic

i'm cool when i'm alone

*makes emotional progress*

*throws it in the trash*

i eat existential dread for breakfast

you better not get over me

trying to get excited about my inner beauty

internet: we NEED to talk about-

me: nah

great, more bad art

planet earth isn't my first choice

*whispers during sex* trust no politician

self-destructive in a gentle way

yesterday my mom called me and i just started yelling about how i want my funeral to be

i love comforting myself with compulsive behaviors

i might not like anyone

curing loneliness with isolation

as long as i die instantaneously i’m totally fine with any kind of death

might be eating alone in a rental car for a bit

this morning a dude reversed his jeep without looking, hard, smashing into my car, then said “sorry i’m having a bad day”

feeling a bit...sad

i don't have fear of missing out, i have fear of being invited

good morning and welcome to the terror of being alive

sext: writing bad poetry about you

“i’m disgusting” -me doing positive affirmations

when someone believes in me i'm like what's wrong with you?

was awake for an hour so it's time to go back to sleep

i regret everything

happiness is cancelled

today’s tweets sponsored by denial, escapism, and an inability to be still with myself or face reality

when i shed the remnants of these ineffectual coping mechanisms i’m still clinging onto like the side of a sinking ship it’s over for you bitches

when i stop trying to crawl back to the womb it’s over for you bitches

mom: happy birthday 
me: what the fuck were you thinking?

it’s my birthday assholes, read my books. thxhttps://twitter.com/sosadtoday/status/1012901697587277826 …

if you don’t like me i'm obsessed with you

Most suspicious of the person who performs good person on the internet

i keep getting older and it's not good

wanna come over and compare suffering?

overwhelmed by most stuff

95% of my ideas are bad and the other 5% i don't act on

i’m old and gross

it’s my birthday tomorrow — as a gift can someone photoshop the weird white tag out of this pic, i need a new old age-updated avatar for my @melissabroder account, thx pic.twitter.com/386NsAHDzN

i only want to talk about sex, death and cereal

horoscope: more mistakes coming soon

if you aren't thinking about me you should be

text me back to tell me you're not going to text me back thx

annoyed that the church of satan has branded the pentagram, like let satan be free! satan belongs to all of us!

decided to just start posting pentagrams

no i don't want you to be happy

in my phone your name is NO

if i can't torture myself about it i don't want to be involved

tell society not to talk to me

oh great another day

me during sex: hurt me

her: you're a few days too slow to this meme, and too early to be ironically late. your meta posts are derivative and uninspired. it's too mainstream to be cool, and not enough to give you the recognition you crave outside of this platform's dying audience

never getting over anything

embarrassed to be alive

want to sleep for 100 days and wake up and eat 100 days worth of food

my heart is stupid

hello childhood defense mechanism my old friend

two roads diverged and i took the one where i didn’t have to feel shit

so done with porn

*watches porn*

i always forget i have depression and believe my thoughts are an objective truth regarding the certainty that i am fucked

when i'm simultaneously trying to get attention and hide from the world that's the real me

hobbies:

what's this? oh it's my emotional baggage

oh no i’m alive

great, i'm alive and filled with longing for things that don't exist

high on insecurity

i like to not do anything about my problems but still worry about them

i was rejected by my mother for eating cake as a child #ShareYourRejection

so what if my most intimate relationship is with a cake

i'm hungry but not sure if i deserve to exist: the musical

eating and masturbating

actually bitch i’m 85 years oldhttps://twitter.com/honeygeryon/status/1029484619379482626 …

small talk requires 100% more energy than making out

people: don’t joke about depression

me: would you prefer i cry about it?

*whispers during sex* it’s not that i think the world would be better without me but that i’d be better without the world and that it wouldn’t matter if i was gone

sometimes i forget i have depression and it’s  like why am i built like a strainer where all the positive stuff drips out and the self-hatred stays in?

what's wrong with me? asking for a friend

new episode of my “show”https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/eating-alone-in-my-car/id1391561169?mt=2&i=1000417703908 …

"i'm a fucking loser, i'm nothing" -me trying to do positive affirmations

whatever i'm doing i'm actually crying

it’s a beautiful day i feel like dying

if i'm relatable you're fucked

horoscope: you shouldn't text him but you will

maybe if i buy this shit i don't need i'll be a whole person

sorry, i know we're having sex but i'm can't stop thinking about mean things people might be saying about me: a memoir

sext: let's be honest, you didn't like me as much as i liked you

this is so fascinating and relatable *points to death*

i either think about you or think about death

oh cool, society is still gross

do you control your fear or does your fear control you?!

my fear controls me.

being invited to a party is an act of war

me: i'm dying
me: you're not dying
me: i'm dying
me: you're not dying
me: i'm dying

i'm scared of people, loneliness, being too much, not being enough, intimacy, rejection, dying, and being alive

the shit that scares you probably won't happen but other bad shit definitely will

now researching: what's wrong with me?

"look on the bright side"

"no"

time doesn't really heal anything but sometimes you find someone new to obsess about

i came, i saw, i blamed myself for everything

let's feel bad for each other

“I love your energy” is what you say when you hate somebody

quoth the raven, don’t text him

currently listening to: me telling myself i'm a piece of shit

5% actual evil coursing thru my veins ugh

you have to learn to love yourself

yeah sorry no

it's important to be a mess

I think I’ve entered the wrong world.

current mood: fucked

being alive is a major problem

sometimes i forget i have depression and it’s like is everyone else just pretending they aren’t horrified that they exist

waiting for a text seems like a legit career

might start an anonymous twitter

i didn’t know the revolution would be so boring

text me back: the musical

i fall in love every ten seconds

life's a bitch and then you think it's maybe going to be okay for a sec and then it's a bitch again

gonna go give a blow job

"get it together" --my dog

things i'm good at: 
not knowing when to stop

i have a headache, probably because i exist

Anxiety is a clue that your body can feel what your mind is finding hard to comprehend.

Decide if a life with people is right for you

oh look it’s a hell of my own making

i really liked you. i mean, I didn't but everyone else is worse

in a committed relationship with insomnia

shit can't get worse

*shit gets worse*

just sitting here quietly thinking I'm a loser

human existence has always been a disaster so at least there's that

what you call “producing” i call “i downloaded some free apps infected with spyware that cut mp3s in half and stitch them back together”

this show is 100% diy, that’s right folks, i eat the shit, i say the shit, i record the shit, i edit the shit, i produce the shit, and i have no idea what the fuck i’m doing and you can totally tellhttps://twitter.com/sosadtoday/status/1026301596903211008 …

the question is not if i am a loser but how big of a loser

i'll show you my emptiness if you show me yours

i have the wrong piercings, hair color, clothes, body and mind

hope someone flirts w me at the cemetery

"just wanna get this over with" -me about everything

leaving the house and other bad ideas

there are so many hot people i'm so upset

Sois gentil avec les gens mais aussi essaye d’éviter les gens

« Dois-je manger, dormir ou me masturber ? », la comédie musicale

first name existential last name crisis

i can't understand people who don't feel like they are dying every single day

had a feeling and buried it in under 1 second

that which does not kill you but makes you slowly retreat from the world

hypersensitive before it was cool

TED talk about staying in bed

high on loneliness

*whispers during sex* i’m insecure so sometimes i retweet my own tweets and then un-retweet

well well well if it isn’t excruciating self-doubt

in a relationship with a muffin

i came, i saw, i got rejected

my first reaction to anything is oh no

today i heard: “yeah they gave everyone working here a water bottle because they banned straws also they’re laying off all the kitchen staff but they brought in street artists to tag people’s water bottles so that’s why they’re lining up”

me: consumerism is poisoning my soul

me: omg i need all this shit i don’t need

breaking news: still don’t love myself

let’s just call it capitalist self-indulgence and leave “self-love” alone

there are two kinds of people in this world and i don’t understand either of them

let me down in a more exciting way

sorry that instead of responding to what you were talking about, i simply glowed with a diffuse primrose light before exploding into a billion particles, eventually spreading to the ends of the universe before contracting back into my human form, by which point you had moved on

in a complicated relationship with the amount of shit i have to do just to stay alive

please keep society away from me, thx

my aesthetic is fear and anxiety

spoiler: your parents fucked you up

i'm a bad movie

i always feel like i'm bleeding psychologically

woke up

i know some of you fear the podcast is haunted bc itunes says “59 seconds” and then it plays for 30 min

same anxiety different day

i'm not the most excited about being alive today

treat everyone with kindness but also try to avoid everyone

people: where can i get your books?

me: under the hoof of a magic truffle pig on a mysterious island known only to three witches. also amazon and bookstores.

in a committed relationship with my obsessive thinking

what's wrong with me: the musical

you should read this bookpic.twitter.com/zU7lYUtnNk

the last person who made me cum has me blocked on IG

i always think everything bad is about me

my superpower is my mother only loved me conditionally

i think i've been alive too long

Ugh do I actually have emotional intelligence or do I just want people to like me :/

be yourself"
but i don't like myself

sext: let's sleep for 100 hours

a group of people is called an annoying

"i'm definitely dying" -me every second

I’m almost 40 and the only item left on my bucket list is not to apologize when someone bumps into me.

are you coming to this in 5 hours? 

i realized i was awful and then i realized it again

i wouldn’t follow me

me and @alexdimitrov tomorrow @BookSoup come thru pic.twitter.com/Gwa0H3v4Ti

when i'm by myself i'm almost ok

live, laugh, love, confuse lust with love, diagnose yourself with fatal illnesses

everyone sucks

fears within one hour of waking:
-i’m not enough 
-it’s all over for me
-i’m doomed 
-my dumb attempts to construct meaning are a delusion
-i will one day face a day of reckoning 
-everyone sees through me
-the universe thinks i’m bad
-i don’t have a wet enough vagina

i almost feel bad for people who can't synthesize their intellect into dark humor to mask their crippling insecurity

sad today

want to throw myself in the trash in a creative way

*sext* sometimes i get scared that way more people hate me than i’m aware of

i've never fit in and it's like thank fucking god

i'm not thinking positively and it's fine

i like to blame myself for everything just in case

existence is a major inconvenience

i don't give a fuck but i totally do

wonder if i’ll win any literary awards or receive any grants in my lifetime?

should i just pee in my pants rn

i’m not dead inside but it sounds so beautiful

posted a video of me peeing so i guess i’m truly an influencer now!

one month and it’s still stupid

accidentally got some vulnerability on me

i want to not give a fuck what anyone thinks of me and for everyone to love me

i hate everything in a whole new way

sorry i turned you into a drug

sry the patterns I carved out of raw chaos, at the behest of a vast & all encompassing biological imperative, didn’t include the various swells of hormones that masquerade as love in the oppressive popular discourse our species calls culture

sorry I called your straw-free cantina a neoliberal mirage

s/o to the glacial pace of forgiveness

it was the best of dicks, it was the worst of dicks

you should love me for me even though i totally don't

don't give up on me, or do it's fine

being infatuated with you has been a real pleasure

i love your dick i mean art

i'm tired of being strong and i'm not even strong

bro does the abyss even gaze back at you

stop peer pressuring me to love myself

All this effort & we’re just some random bitches in a random galaxy

when something good is about to happen i feel like it's already over

when being alive isn't working

hi i'm mediocre

“everyone looks like a fake plastic doll now” -me wishing i looked like a fake plastic doll

“when is this phase going to be over?” -me about everything

oh no a person is trying to talk to me

"i don't need that in my life" --me about everything

catastrophic thinking & fearing the future, crushes on strangers & blaming myself for everything, these are a few of my favorite things

i’m just not that into me

https://www.amazon.com/Pisces-Novel-Melissa-Broder/dp/1524761559 …pic.twitter.com/sgM7iHElTZ

oh no i exist

don't invite me unless it's sleep

meet me at the corner of insomnia and difficulty living in the world

many classic works of literature don’t have enough pussy eating

when people flirt with me i'm like can i get that in writing

if you try to involve me in your 'journey of self discovery,' i  will call  the  police  on  you 

all my life i was told i just needed to pray more which is why i now begin every day by looking up at the sky and screaming THANK YOU GOD FOR MAKING ME THE GAYEST BITCH ALIVE

i'm not good enough for me

when i see people reproducing i'm like what are you doing

PSA - just because you miss someone doesn’t mean you should reach out to them

being my own worst enemy is going ok

retweeting myself for dopamine like the punk i fucking am

having a threesome with love and death

don't obsess about it

yeah ok thanks you fixed me

dopamine speaks louder than words

oh god another day

it's all fun and games until you're born

phd in preparing for people to spontaneously stop liking me

at least i'm not permanent

what if i'm the worst?

Dancing Queen by ABBA is about death.

when I was 20 I took a pic of me and my ex-bf and showed it to my therapist and asked him if it looked like he was still in love with me. he said yes!

i’m always surprised when i like people

i have a headache, probably from being confronted with my own cosmic insignificance

it's my body and i'll shame it if i want to

if i get reincarnated i'm gonna be like are you fucking kidding me?

i love you but i've chosen masturbation

how do I know if I understand social cues

can't tell if i'm about to suffocate, cry, puke, fall asleep, die or become enlightened

i don't like anything related to reality

2. a romper & dad sneakers
3. jorts & a belt with a leopard on it

the fantasy, obvi

i hate that we had a connection

turn-offs include waking up

almost two decades later, I have finally purchased “smooth” by santana featuring rob thomas for one dollar and twenty-nine cents on itunes.

don't mind me i'm just making the same mistakes and expecting diff results

everyone over there looks like they are really enjoying life today, it’s so bad

studies show that i'm the worst

that will only cause you pain

ok cool i'm gonna do it!!!!

loving you was an illness

why are people always asking questions where they assume you have a life?

lied to an uber driver that i have fourth of july plans because i felt like he wanted me to

remember when i thought I knew you but I didn't know you at all

every time i post i go into a shame spiral and delete it, is that what’s supposed to happen
